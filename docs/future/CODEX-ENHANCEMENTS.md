# Manuscript Pro ‚Äî Enhancements & Release Readiness

This live TODO tracks polish, fixes, and release tasks for Manuscript Pro. For detailed Phase 2 authoring work (LaTeX/Pandoc), see CODEX-ENHANCEMENTS-2.md.

## Recently Completed

- Authoring UX: Command Builder + `\` completions; edit‚Äëin‚Äëplace for LaTeX commands/environments; Pandoc attributes editor.
- Table Wizard: CSV/TSV paste; alignment guessing; booktabs/`\hline`; vertical bars; include `\centering`; live preview + copy.
- Frontmatter Editor: structured fields (title/authors/date/abstract/keywords/bibliography/CSL/header‚Äëincludes); typed Variables UI (add/remove/rename; string/number/boolean); header‚Äëincludes literal blocks; CSL status; `.bib` Browse.
- Figure Block inserts: one‚Äëshot helper; Insert from File command with auto label from filename; helpers `\underline`, `\overline`, `\mathbb`, `\input`, `\include`.

## P0 ‚Äî Stability & Release Prep

- [ ] Manifest/version alignment (manifest.json, versions.json; version-bump.mjs).
- [ ] Export paths and Pandoc detection across platforms (Windows/macOS/Linux).
- [ ] Docs final pass (Quick Start, Troubleshooting, Security notes).
- [ ] Test vault scenario across features (Concealment, Citations, Cross‚Äëref, Export, Focus Mode).

## P1 ‚Äî UX Polish

- [ ] Command palette discoverability and help overlays for new tools.
- [ ] Settings organization for Authoring Tools and Export profiles.
- [ ] Minor style tokens pass (dark/light consistency).

## Additional Recently Completed

- Export UX: Export Dialog shows live ‚ÄúEffective CSL‚Äù with ‚úì/‚úó existence check and parses CSL title; updates instantly on text edit and profile change.
- Settings: Global Default CSL path added (Export & Publishing) and used automatically when profiles don‚Äôt specify CSL.
- Export Manager: Injects global default CSL into effective profile.
- Export Engine: Avoids brittle `-t pdf`; relies on output extension and `--pdf-engine` for PDF.
- Concealment: Delimiter-only hiding for patterns like `@{‚Ä¶}` so inner content remains visible; graceful fallback when RegExp indices are unavailable.
- Citations: Hover popup adds ‚Äúüìö Copy BibTeX‚Äù (uses `toBibTeX`) and DOI/URL opener fallback.
- Cross‚Äëreferences: ‚ÄúRename Label and Update Refs‚Äù updates `\label{‚Ä¶}` and all `\ref`/`\eqref`/`\cref`/`\autoref` usages across the vault.
- Focus Mode: Status bar indicator + toggle; hotkey (Mod+Shift+Z); typewriter/centered layout; opacity controls; updates indicator on enable/disable.
- Stats Panel: Auto‚Äërefresh now respects settings cadence and enablement.
- Quality gating: Renamed phase4‚Üíquality across initialization and commands; commands now respect `settings.quality.*`.

## Additional P0 Checks

- [ ] Verify Reading Mode conceal post‚Äëprocessor for interleaved matches and no truncation (indices and fallback).
- [ ] Validate cross‚Äëref rename against substring keys (e.g., `fig1` vs `fig10`).
- [ ] Exercise export across PDF/DOCX/HTML/EPUB; confirm global CSL and override precedence.
- [ ] Confirm Focus Mode commands and status indicator remain in sync after toggle/cycle.

## ‚úÖ Completed Components

### 1. Data Models & Interfaces (`PlotArcInterfaces.ts`)

**Plot Thread System:**
- 6 thread types: main-plot, subplot, character-arc, mystery, romance, custom
- Thread status tracking: active, resolved, abandoned
- Color-coded threads for visualization
- Relationships: characters, related threads, conflicts

**Milestones:**
- 6 milestone types: setup, inciting-incident, rising-action, midpoint, climax, resolution, custom
- Tension ratings (1-10)
- Position tracking (0-100%)
- Story beat integration
- Scene/chapter linking

**Story Structure Support:**
- Three-Act Structure (7 beats)
- Save the Cat (14 beats)
- Hero's Journey (12 beats)
- Seven-Point Story Structure (7 beats)
- Four-Act Structure (7 beats)
- Five-Act Structure (5 beats)
- Custom structure support

**Analysis Features:**
- 7 issue types: unresolved threads, missing climax, flat pacing, orphaned milestones, missing beats, low tension, inconsistent pacing
- Severity levels: critical, warning, info
- Location tracking with suggestions

### 2. Plot Arc Manager (`PlotArcManager.ts`)

**Core Operations:**
- ‚úÖ Create/Read/Update/Delete plot threads
- ‚úÖ Add/Update/Delete milestones
- ‚úÖ Track scene appearances
- ‚úÖ Manage thread relationships

**Analysis Engine:**
- ‚úÖ Detect unresolved plot threads
- ‚úÖ Find missing climaxes
- ‚úÖ Identify flat pacing
- ‚úÖ Check for missing story beats
- ‚úÖ Calculate thread completion percentage

**Data Processing:**
- ‚úÖ Generate tension data points for graphing
- ‚úÖ Aggregate tension calculations
- ‚úÖ Interpolate tension between milestones
- ‚úÖ Filter threads by type/status

**Settings Management:**
- ‚úÖ Story structure selection
- ‚úÖ Visualization preferences
- ‚úÖ Auto-analysis toggle
- ‚úÖ Default colors

- Progress bars for each thread
- Quick actions (edit, delete, toggle visibility)
- Filter by type/status
- Search threads
- Create new thread button
- View switcher (List/Timeline/Graph)

**Implementation Status:** Started

**Estimated Time:** 1-2 days

### 7. Plot Analyzer Panel

**Features to Build:**
- Run analysis button
- Issue list with severity indicators
- Filter by severity/type
- Click to jump to location

- Auto-analysis on save

**Estimated Time:** 1 day

### 8. Integration with Outliner

**Features to Build:**
- Add "Plot Threads" field to Scene interface
- Scene editor shows active threads
- Quick add thread to scene
- Thread indicator in scene list
- Bi-directional linking (scene ‚Üî thread)

**Estimated Time:** 1 day

### 9. Settings UI

**Features to Build:**
- Enable/disable plot tracker
- Story structure selection dropdown
- Visualization toggles

## üí° Design Decisions

**Why Story Structure Beats?**
- Helps writers follow proven narrative frameworks
- Provides automatic plot hole detection
- Guides milestone placement

**Why Tension Ratings?**
- Enables pacing visualization
- Identifies flat sections
- Helps balance story rhythm

**Why Multiple Thread Types?**
- Different threads have different expectations
- Allows color-coding and filtering
- Helps organize complex multi-plot stories

**Why Position (0-100%)?**
- Chapter-agnostic (works for any manuscript length)
- Easy to visualize on timeline
- Flexible for manuscripts without strict chapter divisions

---

## üêõ Known Issues / Decisions Needed

1. **Scene Linking:** Need to decide if scenes are required or optional for milestones
2. **Chapter Numbers:** Auto-calculate from position or manual entry?
3. **Timeline Rendering:** Canvas vs SVG vs HTML/CSS?
4. **Graph Library:** Chart.js, D3.js, or custom?
5. **Mobile Support:** How much functionality works on mobile Obsidian?
